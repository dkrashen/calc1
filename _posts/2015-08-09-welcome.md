Keep in mind that this website is for **two** differenct sections of calculus, with different meeting times, but with the same lecture, homework and exam schedule.

####Basic Logistical Information

**Textbook:**
We will be using the free textbook [Mooculus](https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts), freely available via a creative commons license.

This textbook is part of the [Mooculus Online Calculus 1 project](https://mooculus.osu.edu/), which includes various online course material. We will not be using these materials as a required part of our course, however, these materials can be useful for reinforcing and reviewing materials.

**Homework:**
As described on the [course syllabus](http://dkrashen.github.io/calc1/syllabus.pdf), homework will be due on Fridays, and will be done using the WebWork system. The system should be up and running later this week, and I'll send out a test assignment and instructions as soon as that happens so that everyone can get used to the system.

**Exams:**
The exam schedule is also available on the [course syllabus](http://dkrashen.github.io/calc1/syllabus.pdf). Please make sure that the dates work for you (i.e. you are not going to be out of town, etc). If there are legitimate issues with the dates that you are aware of early on, sometimes accomodations can be made. This is rarely possible at the last minute, however.

####Pre-Course Review Ideas

I strongly recommend that my students review some material from Algebra 2 / Trigonometry / Pre-Calculus both before the course begins, and during the semester. As a first step, I'd recommend the following review material prior to the course:

- Chapter 0 of the [Mooculus textbook](https://github.com/dkrashen/mooculus/raw/master/public/textbook/mooculus.pdf)
- Khan Academy material on [Algebra 2](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2), particularly: [Functions and Graphs](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/functions_and_graphs), [Polynomial and Rational Functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/polynomial_and_rational), [Rational Expressions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/rational-expressions), [Exponential and Logarithmic functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential_and_logarithmic_func), [Logarithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/logarithms-tutorial). There are lots of videos here! These should be, for the most part, review. Skim these videos to fill in gaps in your background knowledge and clarify problems as they arise in your reading of the textbook.
