The first "real" homework assignment (assignment_1) has been put online on the [WebWork system][webwork]. The assignment will be due at the end of next week (August 28). 

####Some remarks

- generally speaking, you will have unlimited attempts to complete each homework assignment. 
- the purpose of the homework is for you to practice and reinforce the concepts from lecture. your homework score is much less important for your overall class performance then whether or not you work through the assignment carefully and concienciously.
- if you don't get the answer right the first time, use this as a warning to guide you in what topics you need to review more carefully.
- because you have unlimited attempts, just because you obtain a perfect score on the homework doesn't necessarily mean you are secure in the material. use the homework to show you what you need more work on, and then do whatever extra review is necessary!
- some of the problems are "optional." these are simply for additional practice and review at your discretion. nevertheless, I strongly suggest doing all problems. the optional problems are listed as worth "0 points" of credit.
