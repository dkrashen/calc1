####Study Hall

Please take advantage of the math department study hall. You can get extra help and a chance to practice problems and interact with students from other sections. It's available for our all sections of 2250 (and a few other classes as well) in Boyd Graduate Studies Room 222, every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 3:30 to 5:30, starting today!

####Whitman Calculus

First of all, I have mentioned in class a few times now that the [Whitman Calculus](https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/calculus/) book might be a nice complementary resource for reading. You can find a direct link to the pdf file for the text at this link:

####Office Hours

Starting tomorrow I will have a weekly office hour Tuesdays from 11 to 12:15 in my office, Boyd Graduate Studies, Room 437. Hope to see you all there at some point!
