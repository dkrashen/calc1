You might have noticed that this week's as well as next week's homework assignments are available online on [WebWork](webwork.math.uga.edu/webwork2/Math2250_Krashen_F15/). Try to get a head start on next week's assignment which is a bit longer!

Enjoy your guest lectures this week, and see you Monday!
