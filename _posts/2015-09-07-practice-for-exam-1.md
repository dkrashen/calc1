The practice sheet for the first exam is now online:

[Practice sheet for exam 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/practice1.pdf)

As I mentioned in class previously, the exam will feature similar types of problems as you can find on this sheet, but will be significantly shorter, since the exam period is only 50 minutes long.  My expectation is that the easier problems on the practice sheet should take 5 minutes or less, while the harder problems should take 10-15 minutes.

We will go over a bit of new material on Tuesday, and will start to discuss this practice sheet. Thursday will be mostly spent on the practice sheet.
