Somewhat late, I have just put a new assignment online, which is due Saturday evening. This covers:

 - some chain rule practice (section 6.1), using the derivative of the logarithm (section 6.2)
 - implicit differentiation (section 6.2)
 - derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions (section 7.2)
 - one related rates warmup (section 8.3)
 
I strongly suggest reading over sections 6.1 and 6.2, having to do mostly with the chain rule and implicit differentiation. You should also take a look at the very short section 8.2, which is a good warmup for thinking about related rates problems.
