It looks like the homework assignment that was supposed to be due this Saturday, was mistakenly put in with a due date of October 10. I have taken the compromise position of having the assignment due next Wednesday, September 30.

Also, note that there is a new assignment online, dealing with related rates problems. This assignment is due Friday, October 2.
