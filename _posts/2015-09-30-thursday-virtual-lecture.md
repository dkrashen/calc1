For this week's Thursday lecture, you can find a series of videos online and some supporting WebWork homework, which I encourage you to start alongside the videos. Here's how I suggest you go about things:

**Part 1, Intro**

 - start with the first video: [Introduction to limits at infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs9p_Du1oVw&list=PLwRA8zj9nt3jxCkj_vD5U4RbvOGtZIAe4&index=1)
 - after the video, read through the [Mooculus textbook]((https://github.com/dkrashen/mooculus/raw/master/public/textbook/mooculus.pdf), pages 36-41 (section 2.2). this will show you a few more examples like the ones in the video.
 - after you are done with the reading, take a look at [Assignment 7 on WebWork](https://webwork.math.uga.edu/webwork2/Math2250_Krashen_F15/Assignment_7), and work through the first 4 problems. This should be straighforward after the reading.
  
**Part 2, L'Hopital's Rule**

 - start with the second video: [L'Hopital's Rule](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwRA8zj9nt3jxCkj_vD5U4RbvOGtZIAe4)
 - after the video, read through the [Mooculus textbook]((https://github.com/dkrashen/mooculus/raw/master/public/textbook/mooculus.pdf), pages 121-128. Take your time, there is a lot here!
 - as you are reading, take a look at some of the remaining problems in [Assignment 7](https://webwork.math.uga.edu/webwork2/Math2250_Krashen_F15/Assignment_7). Some should be straighforward, and some might not be. Do your best, and we'll continue to work on some of these on Monday!
 
**Part 3, Sketching Graphs**

 - Earlier this week, we went over all of Chapter 4 (sketching), and a good deal of Chapter 9 (optimization). Some of this material again appears on the upcoming homework assignment as review, so it is a good idea to go over some of this again. As you work over the problems, make yourself a reading strategy to go over it in small pieces, a few pages a day over the next week.
