It's that time again: the practice sheet for the second exam is now online:

[Practice sheet for exam 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/practice2.pdf)

We will be spending the bulk of this week going reviewing the practice sheet and related problems. Keep in mind that we won't have time to go over all questions on the sheet, and that no solutions will be handed out (although we will work a few out during lecture).
