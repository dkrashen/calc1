The first homework set for the week, Assignment 7.5 is now online on WebWork, and the remaining sets will open later this week.

To get an introduction to the material, while I'm out of town this week, you can take a look at the first video, which should be online here shortly: <br />[Basic Antiderivative Properties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdvUHxQTWzU&index=1&list=PLwRA8zj9nt3hpoPpN-nkj02S2UubAi2eL)

You will be able to find the remaining videos, as they are available, on this youTube playlist: <br />[calc 1: indefinite integrals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdvUHxQTWzU&index=1&list=PLwRA8zj9nt3hpoPpN-nkj02S2UubAi2eL)
