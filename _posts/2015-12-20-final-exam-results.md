The final exams are now graded and the scores are online and available on [eLC](http://elc.uga.edu). Here's how to (roughly) convert your numerical score to a letter grade:

55-73 A

45-54 B

35-44 C

25-34 D

The course grades should be all online soon. Thanks for a great semester, and I hope to see you in future courses!
