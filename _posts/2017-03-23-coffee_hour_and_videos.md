Once more, there will be a coffee hour tomorrow (Friday, February 2). Please stop by the matrix (Boyd 308) between 12:30 and 2. Come and have coffee/baked goods and discuss school, courses, and mathematics. Hope to see you all there!


Also, please check out the videos below for some extra information on limits at infinity, L'hopital's rule, and curve sketching!
