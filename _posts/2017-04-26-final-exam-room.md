Due to some last minute scheduling issues, our final exam room has been changed. Both classes will have their exams in Boyd Graduate Studies Building, Room 222. This is the same building that my office is in, and that the coffee hours are held in.

The exams are still scheduled to be held at the same times as originally scheduled. The times are:

	MATH2250 CRN#43142 May 2, 12:00-3:00pm

	MATH2250 CRN#43008 May 4, 3:30pm-6:30pm
