\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}[1. ]
\setlength{\itemsep}{1cm}
\item (15 minutes?)
The derivative as a function (Section 3.2)
{\color{blue}The students have already seen Theorem 1, page 125
(differentiability implies continuity), and have seen and worked with
some examples of calculating derivatives using the definition.}
\begin{enumerate}[ i. ]
\item
reminder of the definition of the derivative $\displaystyle f'(x) = \lim_{h
\to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$.
\item
Example (from the definition): $\displaystyle f(x) = {x^2 + 5x}$
\end{enumerate}

\item (40 minutes?)
Differentiation Rules (Section 3.3)
\begin{enumerate}[ i. ]
\item
Derivative of a constant, Power rule, Constant multiple rule, Sum rule.
Prove one of these using the definition, but not more (sum rule?).
\item
Give examples of derivatives of polynomial functions 

(like $f(x) = 2x^4 -
3x^2 + 9x - 7$), and using power rule for fractional and negative exponents

(for example, $f(x) = \sqrt x = x^{1/2}$, and $f(x) = 1/x = x^{-1}$).
\item
Make sure to ask for questions here!
\item
Product rule and Quotient rule, examples 

(like $f(x) = (x^2 - 3x + 1)(x^4 -
4x + 6)$, and 
$\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x^3 + 1}$)
\end{enumerate}

\item (20 minutes?)
Group work.

With the time remaining (if any), tell the students to break up into groups
and work on some practice problems like these (write them on the board,
students know well how to break up into groups of about 2-4 students each
and work on problems).
\begin{enumerate}[ i. ]
\item
$f(x) = -x^2 + 3$
\item
$f(x) = 2x^7 - 3/x^3$
\item
$f(x) = (x^2 + 1)(x + 7 - \sqrt x)$
\item
$f(x) = \frac{\sqrt x + 1}{\sqrt x - 1}$
\item (if they finish the others...)
$\displaystyle f(x) = \left(\frac{\sqrt[3] x + 1}{x^6 - 1}\right)\left(1/x
- \frac{4 + x}{1 - x}\right)$
\end{enumerate}


\end{enumerate}
