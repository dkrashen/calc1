\textsc{Intro} $< 5$ minutes

Recall that the slope of the tangent line for a function $f(x)$ at $x = a$
is given by the formula
$$f'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.$$

\bigskip
\textsc{Problem} $15$ minutes

Use this to compute, for $f(x) = \sqrt x$,
\begin{enumerate}[1. ] 
\item $f'(1)$
\item $f'(4)$
\item $f'(81)$
\item a general formula for $f'(x)$ for any value of $x$.
\end{enumerate}

Note: you don't have to do these in order!

\bigskip
\textsc{Problem} ($10$ minutes)

Use this to compute, for $f(x) = \frac 1x$,
\begin{enumerate}[1. ] 
\item $f'(1)$
\item $f'(2)$
\item $f'(3)$
\item a general formula for $f'(x)$ for any value of $x$.
\end{enumerate}

Note: you don't have to do these in order!

\bigskip
\textsc{Conclusion} (5 mins)

Explain that this gives a way to produce from a function $f(x)$ a new
function $f'(x)$, called the derivative of $f(x)$.

Comment: positive derivative means slope of tangent line is positive, means
function is ``going up.'' negative derivative means slope of tangent line
is negative, means function is ``going down.''

\bigskip
\textsc{Next problem: graphical interpretation} (15 mins)

Sketch the graphs of $\sin(x)$ for $x$ between $-\pi$ and $\pi$, but don't
identify the function. also a general cubic. Ask them to
figure out (based on increasing/decreasing), where the derivative is
positive and where it is negative, and sketch the derivatives.
