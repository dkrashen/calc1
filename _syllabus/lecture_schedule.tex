\begin{enumerate}[1. ]

\item \textbf{Orientation}: introduction to the ideas of calculus, differentiation,
integration, fundamental theorem of calculus. basic ideas of limits and
their relevance. common sense definition of limits (recitation).
\item \textbf{Limits and limit laws} (Mooculus Ch 1): formal definition of
limits, example via definition. limit laws (Mooculus, 1.3), examples.
\item \textbf{continuity, squeeze, One sided limits, some diffence
quotients} 
\begin{enumerate}[ \ \  i. ]
\item
limit laws (1.3) give continuity for polynomials, roots, etc. 
\item
mention that trig functions are continuous (continuity in 2.3).
\item
examples, group work (radical cancellation!).
\item
squeeze (1.3.5), sine (1.3.6)
\item
examples, group work (trig stuff)
\item
definition of one sided limits. one-sided limit laws. infinite limits and
asymptotes (2.1).
