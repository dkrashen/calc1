\textsc{Academic Honesty}

As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the
Universityâ€™s academic honesty policy, ``A Culture of Honesty,'' and the
Student Honor Code.  All academic work must meet the standards described in
``A Culture of Honesty'' found at: 
\\ \url{http://www.uga.edu/honesty}.

Lack
of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation
for a violation.  Questions related to course assignments and the academic
honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.}
